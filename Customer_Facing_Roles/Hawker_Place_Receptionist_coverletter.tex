\begin{letter}{Subject: Hawker Place Physiotherapy Receptionist Application }
\opening{Dear Sir/Madam}
I am a post graduate international student at the Australian National University studying computer science. I am looking for job opportunities that help leverage my existing skills while helping me develop further in areas where I feel there are good opportunities.\\ \\
While looking for opportunities, I came across this position titled “Receptionist”, which I feel is a great fit for my profile and leverages my organizational and interpersonal skills. Furthermore, this position utilizes my ability to convey messages in a crisp but engaging manner (my IELTS overall score was 8.0) while also applying it in the health sector. \\ \\
Further, I have a learner’s mindset and am enthused when there are opportunities to learn new skills (soft skills or IT applications / tools etc.)  or when I have an opportunity to engage with diverse cultures or on diverse topics, keeping in mind cultural and confidentiality related sensitivities. I generally approach my work in a structured and organized manner ensuring that the deliverables that I am tasked with are performed with utmost accuracy and attention to detail. Here are some examples in support of the above:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item learnt a programming language called dart while working as a frontend developer for an IoT startup incubated in IIT-Madras, 
	\item analyzed satellite images to draw insights from them and report them without missing any of the technical details and,
	\item engaging with stakeholders – both external and internal, from diverse environments – to explain the outcomes, processes with all relevant details 
\end{enumerate}
 Additionally, I am available all day on Mondays (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM) on weekdays and all day on the weekends. Finally, I appreciate this opportunity specifically as it provides me a good chance to learn and grow while enhancing my interpersonal skills. \\ \\
Thank you and hoping to hear from you soon.
\closing{Regards}
\end{letter}
