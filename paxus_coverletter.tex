\opening{Dear Sir/Madam}
	As a post graduate international student at the Australian National University studying computer science, I am always looking for relevant opportunities. While browsing various online job portals, I noticed a posting for Data entry operator at Brindabella endoscopy center, which was interesting for two reasons 1) I always wondered how the public health machinery works, and this position would give me an in-depth view 2) It gives a broader perspective on how various software tools are designed to make the patient experience smoother and efficient.
	Furthermore, having demonstrated a high level of written and oral communication skills by scoring an 8 in IELTS and having experience working with people from different domains within an organizational setting, makes me a very suitable candidate for the position.
	
\closing{Regards}
