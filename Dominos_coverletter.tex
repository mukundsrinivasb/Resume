\begin{letter}{Subject: Application for Electric Bike Rider at Dominos }
\opening{Dear Sir/Madam}
I am a post graduate international student at the Australian National University studying computer science. I am looking for job opportunities that help leverage my existing skills while helping me develop further in areas where I feel there are good opportunities.\\ \\
While looking for opportunities, I came across this position titled “Electric Bike Rider 2022”, which I feel is a great fit for my profile and leverages my driving skills.  \\ \\
Further, I have a learner’s mindset and am enthused when there are opportunities to learn new skills where I have an opportunity to engage with diverse cultures or on diverse topics, keeping in mind cultural and confidentiality related sensitivities. I generally approach my work in a structured and organized manner ensuring that the deliverables that I am tasked with are performed with utmost accuracy and attention to detail. \\ \\
Finally, residing at Toad Hall provides easy access to opportunities on and near campus, whereby I am available on the evenings (5:00 PM to 8:00 PM) on weekdays and all day on the weekends.  \\ \\
Thank you and hoping to hear from you soon.
\closing{Regards}
